# APCSA
This is a REPO for all my AP Computer Science A Projects that I had to complete (mainly from edhesive.com). This is the PictuLab repo(https://github.com/TristanP-S/PictureLab). Here is the extra credit problems: https://github.com/TristanP-S/APCSA2019-Extra-Credit-Problems
## Notice
A lot of the projects concepts come from Edhesive.com
Anyone who submits this code as their own is plagiarizing code, I am not responsible for anyone who does.
These files are here for me to reflect on in the future, and hold no real significance to others.
If contacted from someone from Edhesive, I will make this repo private immediatly.
